# GuidedTours
GuidedTours is an Android application that allows the user to explore and learn more about the area around them by experiencing a self-guided tour. 

The app presents the user with a list of pre-existing tours based off of the device's location from its database. The user can then travel to each destination. If the user selects a destination they are directed to an activity with detailed information about that destination. 

Features to be implemented:
- Allow users to create their own tours. 
- Allow users to save tours and add them to user defined lists (favorites, wish list, etc.)
